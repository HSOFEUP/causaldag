title: UT-IGSP (Unknown-Target Interventional GSP)
description: Learning causal graphs from interventional data with unknown (or partially known) intervention targets.
---

The UT-IGSP algorithm learns a causal graph from interventional data. UT-IGSP is implemented as a part of the [causaldag](https://github.com/uhlerlab/causaldag) package. The source code
for UT-IGSP can be found in the package [here](https://github.com/uhlerlab/causaldag/blob/master/causaldag/structure_learning/dag/gsp.py). UT-IGSP is described in our paper, [Permutation-Based Causal Structure Learning
with Unknown Intervention Targets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09007.pdf).


## Install
To install the causaldag package:
```
$ pip3 install causaldag
```

## Simple Example
