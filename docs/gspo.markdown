title: GSPo (Greedy Sparsest Poset)
description: Learning causal graphs in the presence of latent variables.
---

The GSPo algorithm learns causal graphs, up to Markov equivalence, from observational data with latent confounders.
GSPo is implemented as a part of the [causaldag](https://github.com/uhlerlab/causaldag) package. The source code
for GSPo can be found in the package [here](https://github.com/uhlerlab/causaldag/blob/master/causaldag/structure_learning/mag/gspo.py). 
GSPo is described in our paper, [Ordering-Based Causal Structure Learning in the Presence of Latent Variables
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09014).
